# Living by The Three Mantras

I have lived by these three mantras for almost three decades, and I believe I have defied the conventional notion that once you reach a certain age, you will acquire a particular look as a constituent of aging. I think this is not true, and I hope the pictures below make you rethink that conventionality. Following the Three mantras give you everything you need to obtain and maintain a fit looking body through the decades.

# **My physique through the decades.**

## An almost 30 years pictures review as I follow "The three mantras."

# They used to call me "Little pig"

My childhood friends helped me start my fitness pursue by pointing out how I was the chubby of the group. They used to call me "Little Pig" In the same way, I used to get struck by comments about my physical development. They would exclaim, when are you going to grow taller?. Yes, I was genetically prone to be small, stocky and chubby. There must be a way to overcome or at least improve this "condition" I thought to myself, and right after, my journey started. My goal? to override at the cellular level my "endowed" genetic tendencies. I trained diligently almost every day for over eight years and up until entering the Colombian Military Forces to do my obligatory Military Service. Today over 30 years later my search continues and redefining myself from the inside out continues to be my goal.

# Following The Three Mantras...

What you need to know and apply to get and stay in shape.

Pulling, pushing and pressing against resistances are the ways to maintain your body's functionality.

"Muscles are best stimulated when contracting against external resistances."

Proper exercise improves our hormonal system which in term, maintains our health. Resistance training is the most natural way to improve our hormonal system.

Eat to provide your body the nutrients it needs rather than eating for pleasure.

"Eating well should not be a diet plan, rather, a well planned diet."

As we age, we lose muscles. Resistance training builds and maintain lean muscle tissue.

By doing resistance training we train our body to to handle other than our own body weight.

One way to maintain your metabolism high through the decades is by building lean muscle tissue. Resistance training is the perfect tool to accomplish it.

Every pound of lean muscle tissue burns additional 50 calories every day according to research. Build lean muscle through resistance training.

## 1st Mantra...

# Resistance training is the fastest way to shape up your body and keep it that way.

If you have always ended up with fluctuating results when trying to get in shape, you need to know that doing resistance training is at the top of choices to achieve the body you've always wanted. Whether it is weight training, electrical stimulation, vibration training, tubing resistance, body weight training, these are all proven to shape up your body and make it tight all over. With weight training been the most effective and commonly used to get men and women in shape.

## 2nd Mantra...

# Eat plain foods mainly protein and carbohydrates to support your resistance training.

Plain protein and carbohydrates meal samples.

## Eat the way lean people eat. They stick to these basics, and so you should as well. [Learn the basics of nutrition here][0].

## Follow the ones that live by what they preach.

A proper workout program must be coupled with the right eating plan if you already have a personal trainer you got that basic covered. A good personal trainer that lives by what they preach is your best bet to master eating in a way that supports your training program. Bodybuilders and fitness competitors alike have developed a way of eating that supports their specific needs and allow them to develop and maintain their physique. I am one of those with all the experience gained through years of living by what I preach

## **3rd Mantra...**

# **Sleep**!

(not on the workplace!)

## Your body recovers and rebuilds lean muscle tissue during sleep, not during the actual workout. According to researchers, you should be in bed by eleven to reap the most benefits.
